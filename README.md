# YOLO Object Detection with Ultralytics and Roboflow

This project demonstrates how to train a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model using the Ultralytics package and Roboflow platform. With just a few lines of code, you can train a powerful model for detecting objects in images.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command to install the Ultralytics package:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

You'll also need to install the Roboflow package:

```bash
pip install roboflow
```

## Usage

### 1. Setting up the Dataset

1. Sign up or log in to [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
2. Create a new workspace and project, and upload your dataset.
3. Generate the YOLOv8-OBB format for your dataset.
4. Access the project and version, and download the dataset.

### 2. Training the Model

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize Roboflow with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Access the project and version
project = rf.workspace("YOUR_WORKSPACE").project("YOUR_PROJECT")
version = project.version(1)

# Download the dataset
dataset = version.download("yolov8-obb")

# Initialize YOLO model
yolo = YOLO()

# Train the model
yolo.train(data=dataset, epochs=100, imgsz=640)
```

### 3. Further Customization

You can customize the training parameters according to your requirements. Refer to the documentation for more details.
